Updatingヾ(•ω•`)o~

---             

While retaining the original buildings,we have
- more buildings  
- wider arenas  
- More positive updates

If you have a preferred architectural design that is highly reusable, feel free to submit an issue.  I will try my best to meet your requirements using my average coding skills.

Tired of building the same old wooden boxes every time you start a new Terraria playthrough? ***Magic Builder*** makes housing fun and easy with biome-themed houses and utility structures that can be summoned with magical consumables.

The mod also features a new NPC called the Homebearer, who is obsessed with homes and can communicate with them. The Homebearer will move in to investigate the homeness of your world if you have the campfire buff. Chat with him to learn more about his unique collection methods, or to check on what houses he has to offer.
